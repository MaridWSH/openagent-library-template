Description: Complete installation guide...
Primary Keyword: Claude Code
Category: Quick Wins
```

**Convert to Brief:**

1. Use title, keyword, description as starting point
2. Run SERP analysis for competitive landscape
3. Define audience and intent from category
4. Build outline from description + SERP research
5. Add internal linking plan from site audit
6. Set requirements based on content tier

### Brief vs. Workflow C Decision Tree

```
Need content created?
│
├─ Delegating to writer/team?
│   └─ YES → Create Content Brief
│
├─ Creating with Claude directly?
│   └─ YES → Use Workflow C
│
└─ Hybrid (Claude draft, human refinement)?
