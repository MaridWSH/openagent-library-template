# Workflow S: Content Strategy

- **Purpose:** Transform raw keyword research into strategic content opportunities
- **Input:** JSON response from SEO Boost API
- **Output:** Single comprehensive Markdown artifact with full analysis
- **Capacity:** 200-300 keywords per execution

---

## Execution Mode: Autonomous + Single Artifact Output

**Process Flow:**

1. Receive JSON response from SEO Boost API (paste or reference)
2. Filter irrelevant keywords in pre-processing (SILENTLY - never mention in output)
3. Process all stages in memory (no external API calls)
4. Output complete analysis as single Markdown artifact

**No external dependencies** - all processing happens in Claude's context.

**Execution Principles:**

- Filter irrelevant keywords SILENTLY before categorization - never mention filtering in artifact
- Apply categorization rules in exact sequence - first match wins
- Use precise boundary conditions (>= not >, <= not <)
- Never categorize with qualifiers like "technically should be X" - get it right the first time
- Include complete data tables - this artifact is a standalone resource for downstream workflows
- Validate categorization logic before generating artifact

---

## Input Requirements

### JSON API Response Format

The input is a JSON response from the SEO Boost API with this structure:

```json
{
  "primary_keyword": "string",
  "execution_time": "string",
  "total_keywords": number,
  "total_paa_questions": number,
  "total_subtopics": number,
  "total_serp_results": number,
  "keywords_by_type": {
    "KW Related": number,
    "KW Suggestion": number,
    "KW Idea": number
  },
  "keywords": [
    ["keyword", msv, difficulty, "intent", "competition", cpc, "type"],
    ...
  ],
  "paa_questions": ["question 1", "question 2", ...],
  "subtopics": ["subtopic 1", "subtopic 2", ...],
  "serp_results": [
    ["url", "domain", "title", "description", "type"],
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Keywords Array Format

Each keyword entry is an array with these values in order:

| Index | Field       | Description                                                          |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Keyword     | The keyword phrase                                                   |
| 1     | MSV         | Monthly search volume (numeric or null)                              |
| 2     | Difficulty  | Keyword difficulty 0-100 (numeric or null)                           |
| 3     | Intent      | Intent type (informational, commercial, transactional, navigational) |
| 4     | Competition | LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH                                                    |
| 5     | CPC         | Cost per click (numeric or null)                                     |
| 6     | Type        | Keyword type (KW Suggestion, KW Related, KW Idea)                    |

**Example keyword entry:**

```json
["claude code extension", 110, 10, "commercial", "LOW", 14.92, "KW Suggestion"]
```

The Primary Keyword is extracted from the `primary_keyword` field in the JSON response.

---

## Processing Stages (Autonomous Execution)

### STAGE 1: Data Ingestion & Validation

1. Parse JSON response from SEO Boost API
2. Extract Primary Keyword from `primary_keyword` field
3. Count total keywords from `keywords` array
4. Validate data quality:
   - Count keywords with full metrics (MSV + Difficulty)
   - Count keywords with partial metrics
   - Count keywords by Type from `keywords_by_type`

### STAGE 1.5: Relevance Filtering (SILENT - NOT MENTIONED IN OUTPUT)

**Purpose:** Remove obviously irrelevant keywords to improve data quality and reduce noise.

**CRITICAL: Filtering happens in background. Never mention filtered keywords, filtering process, or filtered count anywhere in the artifact output.**

**Filter out keywords that are clearly unrelated to the Primary Keyword:**

**Detection Heuristics:**

1. **Celebrity/Person Names:**

   - Contains full names pattern: [First Name] + [Last Name]
   - Examples: "claude monet", "claude debussy", "claude rains", "jean claude van damme"
   - Detection: Check if keyword contains common first/last name combinations

2. **Geographic Locations:**

   - Contains city, country, or place names unrelated to the product
   - Examples: "claude cormier montreal", "claude bosi esher"
   - Detection: Check for location keywords + name patterns

3. **Unrelated Products/Brands:**

   - Contains product names clearly unrelated to primary keyword domain
   - Examples: "louis code vein" (video game), "jules code" (unrelated product)
   - Detection: Check for brand/product names from different industries

4. **Off-Topic Terms:**
   - Keyword exists but topic is completely unrelated to primary keyword
   - Example: If primary keyword is "Claude Code" (software), filter "claude chappe code" (historical figure)

**Action:**

- Remove these keywords from ALL subsequent processing (categorization, clustering, content ideas)
- DO NOT create any "Filtered Keywords" list in the output
- DO NOT mention filtering in Executive Summary
- DO NOT include filtered keywords section anywhere in artifact
- Present the artifact as if you only received the relevant keywords to begin with

**Filtering Principles:**

- **Be conservative** - when in doubt, keep the keyword
- **Focus on obvious cases** - clear celebrity names, locations, unrelated products
- **Context matters** - "claude" alone could be relevant, "claude debussy" is not

### STAGE 2: Strategic Categorization

**CRITICAL:** Apply rules in exact order listed. First matching rule wins. Do not skip ahead.

Apply this decision tree to EVERY keyword in sequence:

```
RULE 1: PAA Questions
IF Type = "People Also Ask":
  -> Category: "Intent Signals"
  -> Reasoning: "PAA question - excellent for featured snippets"

RULE 2: Question Keywords
ELSE IF keyword starts with (how/what/why/when/where/who/which/is/are/can/do/does) OR contains "?":
  -> Category: "Intent Signals"
  -> Reasoning: "Question format ([first word]) - ideal for SERP features"

RULE 3: Low-Volume Semantic Keywords
ELSE IF Type = "autocomplete" OR "Subtopic" OR "KW Related" AND (MSV is null OR MSV < 50):
  -> Category: "Semantic Topics"
  -> Reasoning: "[Type] keyword - builds topical authority"

RULE 4: Quick Wins (PRIORITY CHECK)
ELSE IF MSV >= 101 AND Difficulty <= 29 AND Difficulty is not null:
  -> Category: "Quick Wins"
  -> Reasoning: "Low difficulty ([Difficulty]) with good volume ([MSV])"

  EXAMPLES:
  - MSV: 210, Difficulty: 2 -> Quick Wins
  - MSV: 110, Difficulty: 10 -> Quick Wins
  - MSV: 320, Difficulty: 5 -> Quick Wins

RULE 5: High-Difficulty Authority Targets
ELSE IF Difficulty >= 51 AND MSV >= 201 AND Difficulty is not null:
  -> Category: "Authority Builders"
  -> Reasoning: "Competitive ([Difficulty]) but valuable ([MSV])"

RULE 6: Emerging Topics (Low Volume)
ELSE IF MSV <= 100 AND MSV >= 1 AND MSV is not null:
  -> Category: "Emerging Topics"
  -> Reasoning: "Low volume ([MSV]) - early mover advantage"

  EXAMPLES:
  - MSV: 90, Difficulty: 10 -> Emerging Topics
  - MSV: 70, Difficulty: 5 -> Emerging Topics
  - MSV: 50, Difficulty: 0 -> Emerging Topics

RULE 7: Moderate Metrics (100-200 MSV, 30-50 Difficulty)
ELSE IF MSV >= 101 AND MSV <= 200 AND Difficulty >= 30 AND Difficulty <= 50:
  IF Intent = "informational":
    -> Category: "Authority Builders"
    -> Reasoning: "Informational with moderate metrics"
  ELSE:
    -> Category: "Quick Wins"
    -> Reasoning: "Commercial/transactional with moderate metrics"

RULE 8: No Metrics Available
ELSE IF MSV is null AND Difficulty is null:
  -> Category: "Semantic Topics"
  -> Reasoning: "No volume data - supporting term for topic authority"

RULE 9: High Volume Default
ELSE IF MSV >= 201:
  -> Category: "Authority Builders"
  -> Reasoning: "High volume ([MSV]) - authority target"

RULE 10: Catch-All
ELSE:
  -> Category: "Unknown"
  -> Reasoning: "Insufficient data - manual review recommended"
```

**Validation Check:**
After categorization, verify:

- Keywords with MSV 1-100 -> Should be Emerging Topics (unless Rule 1-3 caught them)
- Keywords with MSV 101+ AND Difficulty 0-29 -> Should be Quick Wins (unless Rule 1-3 caught them)
- No keyword should be "technically" wrong category

**Count by category after categorization.**

### STAGE 3: Semantic Clustering

**Purpose:** Group keywords into 4-6 thematic clusters based on semantic relationships.

**Clustering Scope:**
Only cluster keywords suitable for content creation:

- **Include:** Quick Wins, Authority Builders, Intent Signals, Emerging Topics (if relevant)
- **Exclude:** Semantic Topics (autocomplete, subtopics), Unknown category
- **Target:** 60-80% of total keywords clustered (the rest are supporting/tangential terms)

**Clustering Approach:**

1. Identify broad themes in the keyword set
2. Group keywords by shared user intent and topic
3. Create 4-6 clusters (minimum 5 keywords per cluster)
4. Each keyword belongs to exactly ONE cluster

**For each cluster, define:**

- **Cluster Name:** 2-4 word descriptive name
- **Core Topic:** One sentence describing the theme
- **Intent Pattern:** Primary user intent
- **Keywords:** All keywords in this cluster
- **Reasoning:** Why these keywords group together

**Common cluster patterns for SEO keyword research:**

- Pricing & Cost Investigation
- Product/Tool Comparisons
- Feature & Capability Exploration
- Setup & Implementation Guides
- General Platform Information
- Best Practices & Optimization

### STAGE 4: Content Ideas Generation

**Content Idea Generation Scope:**

Generate content ideas ONLY for:

- Quick Wins
- Authority Builders
- Intent Signals
- Emerging Topics (if relevant to primary keyword)

**Do NOT generate content ideas for:**

- Semantic Topics (supporting terms only - used for topical authority, not primary content)
- Unknown category

**Final Count Calculation:**
Total content ideas = (category-based ideas for relevant keywords) + (hub articles) + (spoke articles)

#### Part A: Category-Based Content Ideas

For each categorized keyword (in scope per above), generate:

**Title (under 60 characters):**

- Use title templates based on keyword pattern:
  - **"vs" keywords:** "[A] vs [B]: Complete Comparison 2025"
  - **"what is" keywords:** "What Is [Topic]? Complete Guide 2025"
  - **"how to" keywords:** "How to [Action]: Step-by-Step Guide"
  - **Question keywords:** "[Question]: Everything You Need to Know"
  - **Pricing keywords:** "[Product] Pricing Guide 2025: Plans & Costs"
  - **Best practice keywords:** "[Topic] Best Practices: Expert Tips 2025"
  - **Generic keywords:** "[Keyword]: Complete Guide 2025"

**Description (50-120 words):**

- 2-3 sentences outlining main topics
- Indicates specific value for readers
- Incorporates keyword naturally

#### Part B: Hub/Spoke Strategy

For EACH cluster, create:

**1 Hub Article (pillar content):**

- Title: Comprehensive guide covering entire cluster theme
- Description: 3-4 sentences covering full scope
- Type: "hub"
- Keyword: Most relevant keyword from cluster

**3 Spoke Articles (supporting content):**

- Title: Specific subtopic within cluster
- Description: 2-3 sentences on focused aspect
- Type: "spoke"
- Keyword: Specific keyword from cluster

**Select spokes to cover:**

1. Different approach/angle
2. Specific use case
3. Detailed how-to
4. Comparison/options (if applicable)
5. Advanced/specific aspect (if 5 spokes instead of 3)

**Total articles per cluster:** 1 hub + 3 spokes = 4 articles
**Total articles for 6 clusters:** 24 articles
